## Agentic Design Patterns

### [Pattern 01 - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Agents](01-rag-agent/README.md)

RAG Agents are designed to retrieve information from a multitude of sources, including databases, documents, and APIs, and then use this information to generate an answer.

This pattern will focus on Retrieval from unstructured data, which comes with a lot of challenges including the need to understand the context to deliver on accuracy, performance and cost of operation.

We put RAG in perspective within the context of an Agentic AI System, to showcase how complex problems can be solved by a RAG enabled agent.

### [Pattern 02 - Code Generation Agents](02-code-generation-agent/README.md)

This pattern covers the design and implementation of agents that can generate code snippets, functions, or even entire programs based on a set of requirements. This pattern is particularly useful for developers who want to increase their productivity while respecting existing code standards, libraries, reference architectures, and best practices.

The applicability of a Code Generation Agent is vast, and we will cover the most common scenarios, namely:
- coding assistance
- code translation
- automated testing

### [Pattern 03 - Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)](03-multi-agent-systems/README.md)

This pattern explores best practices for building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that consist of multiple agents. Each agent focuses on a specific functional area, and they are coordinated to combine their capabilities, offering a unified, enhanced super-agent experience to the end user. The primary goal is to scale the agent system across multiple functional domains. The pattern will address several key aspects of MAS, including:  
  
- Decomposition of the overall system's functional scope into more manageable segments.  
- Designing mechanisms for routing and forwarding.  
- Management of shared memory and state transitions across agents.  
- Handling the transition of communication flow from one agent to another.
