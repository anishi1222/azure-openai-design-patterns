# azure-genai-design-patterns

## Introduction

This repository contains a set of design patterns illustrating how to effectively use LLMs (Large Language Models) in Azure to power advanced use cases.

The intent is to provide guidance around the building blocks and approaches to deliver common scenarios. This should be considered as a foundation to build prototypes and eventually production ready solutions.

This represents learnings from 100s of use cases observed so far. The patterns are not exhaustive and will evolve over time. We welcome contributions from the community to help us improve the patterns and add new ones.

## Structure

This repository is structured in 3 main sections:

### [1. Foundational Elements of Advanced Generative AI Use Cases](1_foundational_elements/README.md)

This section covers all the core principles and foundational elements that are common to all the patterns. It is a good starting point to understand the basics of generative AI, and all the key frameworks around it that enable advanced scenarios.

This section covers a multitude of concetps and frameworks built to implement these concepts. This will help you understand:
- which elements are crucial to your solution
- design considerations that lead to production ready solutions, including Responsible AI and UX considerations

### [2. Design Patterns](2_design_patterns/README.md)

This section puts in perspective the foundational elements and provides a set of design patterns that are commonly used in the industry.

Each pattern is designed to solve a specific problem and is backed by a set of best practices and implementation guidelines.

Here you will find the most advanced common scenarios with reference architectures detailing what challenges they address, how to implement them, and the performance and limitations of each pattern.

### [3. Design Patterns Accelerators](3_design_patterns_accelerators/README.md)

This area provides sample implementations of some of the patterns as ready to go solution, with miminum configurations and code changes. 

This is a good starting point to understand how to implement the patterns in real world scenarios and test them out with your own data.
