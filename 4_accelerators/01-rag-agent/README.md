## DEEPRAG ACCELERATOR  
  
The DeepRAG repository offers a comprehensive implementation of an intelligent research agent designed to perform multi-step reasoning research on data to answer user questions. This agent is capable of handling complex queries that require several steps of reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.  
  
### Key Features  
  
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: The DeepRAG agent can conduct in-depth research by breaking down complex queries into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and thorough responses.  
    
- **Multi-Modal Search**: Supports searching across various data types, including both text and images, enabling a more versatile and comprehensive search capability.  
  
- **Graph Support**: Integrates graph-based data structures to enhance the reasoning process. This allows the agent to understand and manipulate complex relationships and connections between data points, leading to more insightful and accurate answers.
