# Code Generation 

## Use Cases

[ describe the use cases and typical industry scenarios which match the pattern. the goal is to understand the context in which the pattern is used ]

## Challenges

[ why is this difficult to do? what should be considered to solve the problem? ]

## Solution Patterns

---
### Pattern 1: (name it)
---
#### Approach

[ describe the approach ]

#### Implementation

[ this does not need to be a fully working implementation, but should provide enough information to understand the approach]

[ provide pseudo code or notebooks, etc. in 'src' directory ]

[ include architecture diagrams in 'assets' directory as needed to illustrate the approach ]

#### Performance

[ discuss / evaluate the performance of the approach (accuracy, speed, etc.) for instance here, use Rouge() or BERTScore()]

#### Strengths

[ discuss the strengths of the approach ]

#### Limitations

[ when does this approach fails or is not recommended ]
