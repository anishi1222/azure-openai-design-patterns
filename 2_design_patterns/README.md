## Agentic Design Patterns

### [Pattern 01 - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Agents](01-rag-agent/README.md)

RAG Agents are designed to retrieve information from a multitude of sources, including databases, documents, and APIs, and then use this information to generate an answer.

This pattern will focus on Retrieval from unstructured data, which comes with a lot of challenges including the need to understand the context to deliver on accuracy, performance and cost of operation.

We put RAG in perspective within the context of an Agentic AI System, to showcase how complex problems can be solved by a RAG enabled agent.

### [Pattern 02 - Code Generation Agents](02-code-generation-agent/README.md)

This pattern covers the design and implementation of agents that can generate code snippets, functions, or even entire programs based on a set of requirements. This pattern is particularly useful for developers who want to increase their productivity while respecting existing code standards, libraries, reference architectures, and best practices.

The applicability of a Code Generation Agent is vast, and we will cover the most common scenarios, namely:
- coding assistance
- code translation
- automated testing

### [Pattern 03 - Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)](03-multi-agent-systems/README.md)

This pattern discusses best practices to build Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that can understand and execute complex instructions leveraging a multitude of services to plan, evaluate, replan and achieve complex goals with potential human collaboration.

The pattern will cover some key-aspects of MAS, including:
- agent-to-agent communication
- self-evaluation and replanning
- human-agent collaboration
